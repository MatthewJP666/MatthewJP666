### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings there!

I'm a small developer, aiming to discover and traverse through the countless oceans, jungles, and voyage throughout the magestical depths of space bound to gain a fleet through the indefinite stars.

I love playing around with the terminal sometimes scripting away.

- 🔭 Astrophysics fan!
- 🌱 Usally preparing something.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
