### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings there!

I'm a small developer, aiming to discover and traverse through countless of the oceans, jungles, and voyage throughout the magestical depths of space bound to gain a fleet through the indefinite stars.

I love playing around with the terminal sometimes scripting away. I'm pretty chill.

- 🔭 Astrophysics fan!
- 🌱 I’m currently preparing something.
- 🐧 I'm a Linux user!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
